As a PhD-level computational biologist and data scientist, I have extensive experience applying my technical skills to complex biological datasets. My research to date has focused on using genomic and transcriptomic data to examine sex and hormone-related variability. I am eager to continue working with these and other 'omics data types in order to advance understanding of human health. I also am passionate about teaching and mentoring students in the sciences.
