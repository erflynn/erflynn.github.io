I am a computational biologist and data scientist by training, passionate about research and working with students. I am currently a PhD candidate in Biomedical Informatics at Stanford University graduating during the summer of 2021.

## Undergraduate training and research
I received my BA in Computer Science and Biochemistry and a concentration in Biomathematical Sciences from Smith College in 2014. I graduated with highest honors in Computer Science and did my honors thesis with Dr. Ileana Streinu on methods for visualization and comparing protein rigidity models with [KINARI-Web](http://kinari.cs.umass.edu/Site/index.html). My research was supported by a Goldwater Fellowship and a Computer Science Clare Booth Luce Scholarship. Additionally, I spent the summer of 2013 at the Cold Spring Harbor Undergraduate Research Program working with Dr. Thomas Gingeras on comparing next-generation sequencing methods for enriching transcription start sites. Prior to becoming a dry lab scientist, I worked in Dr. Adam Hall's neuroscience lab studying molecular mechanisms of anesthetic preconditioning.

## Graduate training and research
As a PhD student in [Biomedical Informatics](https://med.stanford.edu/bmi.html), I have taken extensive coursework on data analysis, computer science, statistics, and applications of these methods to biological and medical data. I did my dissertation research with Dr. Russ Altman in the [Helix group](https://helix.stanford.edu/). My PhD [research](/research/) focused on between and within-sex variability in gene expression and genetic data. In addition to research, I was highly involved in [teaching and mentoring](/teaching/).

At Stanford, I was a [Data Science Scholar](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-data-science-scholars-program), NSF Graduate Research Fellow, and NIH NLM F31 Predoctoral Fellow. In addition, some of my projects were supported by grants from the Stanford Women's Health and Sex Differences (WHSDM) Center and the UCSF-Stanford FDA Center for Regulatory Science and Innovation (CERSI).

## Other
In my free time, I like to bake bread, hang out with my fluffy gray cat, swim, and explore the bay area on foot and by bike.
