I am passionate about teaching and mentoring students and have taken multiple opportunities to do so during my time at Stanford.

During the summer of 2019, I was a technical mentor for the [Stanford Data Science for Social Good](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/data-science-social-good/2019-data-science-social-good) summer program. I worked with the two other technical mentors to develop trainings ([repo](https://github.com/stenhaug/dssg_stanford)) and coordinate collaborations and mentor students on projects with the Stanford Blood Center (on forecasting platelet use) and Veteran's Health Administration (on assessing bias of an opiate prediction tool).

I have been a teaching assistant twice and worked on course development for _BIOMEDIN 214: Representations and Algorithms for Computational Molecular Biology_ and the Stanford ADVANCE Summer program _Introduction to R Course_ ([repo](https://github.com/alejandroschuler/r4ds-courses/tree/advance-2020)) for incoming biology graduate students (2020, 2021). I also had the opportunity to shadow a Computer Science professor at Foothill Community College through the [Stanford Preparing Future Professors](https://vpge.stanford.edu/events/programs/preparing-future-professors) program. For all of these courses, I developed and gave one or two lectures per quarter.

Additonally, I have had the opportunity to mentor students at the high school, college, and graduate school levels. I tutored high school students throught the East Palo Alto Tennis and Tutoring (EPATT) Program. I also mentored a community college graduate student through the _Inclusive Mentoring in Data Science_ program and mentored two undergraduate students on my research projects. Finally, I have acted as mentor to many first year graduate students through Biosciences programs, advising on rotations, coursework, and transition to graduate school, as well as helping students prepare fellowship applications.
